processes	within	an	Organisation
Organisations	today,	small,	medium	and	large	depend	on	digital	datasets as	part	of	their	day-to-day	
activities.	 Database	 Management	 Systems	 as	 a	 software	 solution,	 play	 a	 key	 role	 in	 managing	
transactional/operational	data.	Such	systems	hold	very	little	value	if	they	are	not	utilised correctly	to	
support	 effective	 decision	 making. In	 this	 assignment,	 identify	 one	 real-world	 organisation	 and	
provide	the	following	deliverables for	that	organisation:
1) Introduction
[Text	and	references,	1	Diagram +	AI	Journal],	[1	PDF],	[5%]
a. State	your	organisation	and	provide	a	clear	set of	 functional	requirements(s) for	its	 ICT	
infrastructure	 which	 your	 assignment	 will	 be	 focusing	 on	 e.g.	 customer	 support	 via	
chatbots,	 HR	 ICT	 systems	 to	 manage the	 addition	 of	 new	 staff.	 For	 your	 functional	
requirements,	a	decision-making	element	needs	to	be	embedded. Max	5	references.
b. To	complete	this	section,	use	any	AI	tool	that	you	wish.	Write	up	max	200	words	in	your	AI	
Journal	on	how	you	leveraged	an	AI	 tool	 to	deepen	your	understanding	on	your	area	of	
interest within	your	target	organisation.	Provide	your	top	3	AI	queries		responses and	
attach	at	the	end	of	this	introduction.	Use	some	of	your	200	words	in	your	AI	Journal	to	
comment	on	these	AI	queries.
2) Background	Research	
[Text,	diagram	and	references	+	AI	Journal],	[1	PDF],	[15%]
a. For	 your	 specific	 scenario (target	 organisation	and	 functional	 requirements) undertake	
general	 background	 research	 into	 the	 different	 ICT	 platforms/solutions	 which	 may	
interact	 with	 your	 DBMS.	 Develop	 one	 diagram	 that	 shows	 all	 the	 components	
interconnected, with	your	DBMS	as	the	central	component. Max	10	references.
b. To	complete	this	section,	use	any	AI	tool	that	you	wish.	Write	up	max	250	words	in	your	AI	
Journal	on	how	you	leveraged	an	AI	tool	to	deepen	your	understanding	on	the	application	
of	different	ICT	solutions	within	your	target	organisation.	Provide	your	top	3	AI	queries		
responses	and	attach	at	the	end	of	this	background.	Use	some	of	your	250	words	in	your	
AI	Journal	to	comment	on	these	AI	queries.
3) Entity	Relationship	Diagram	(ERD)	
[Text,	ERD,	Video +	AI	Journal],	[1	Video	and	1	PDF],	[15%]
a. Develop	1	ERD	using	crow’s	foot	notation	with	max	7	entities.	All	attributes,	relationships,	
cardinalities,	modalities	need	to	be	stated.
b. Max	 5-minute	 video	(screen	 capture	 recording)	 of	 you	 describing	 your	 ERD,	 the	 logic	
behind	your	ERD	and	how	you	found	AI	useful/or	not	in	helping	you	to	develop	your	ERD.
c. To	complete	this	section,	use	any	AI	tool	that	you	wish.	Write	up	max	300	words	in	your	AI	
Journal	on	how	you	leveraged	an	AI	tool	to	develop	your	ERD.	Provide	your	top	3	AI	queries	
	 responses	and	attach	at	 the	end	of	 this	ERD. Use	some	of	 your	300	words	in	 your	AI	
Journal	to	comment	on	these	AI	queries.
4) DBMS	Solution
[MySQL	database, Video	+	AI	Journal],	[1	MySQL	database,	1	Video and	1	PDF],	[45%]
a. Using	MySQL	create	a	database	and	develop	the	associated	tables,	relationships etc based	
on	your	ERD.
b. Populate	your	tables	with	dummy	data,	minimum	20	rows	of	data	per	table.	If	you	wish	to	
import	publicly	available	data,	please	reference	the	data	source	e.g.	https://data.cso.ie/
c. Provide	all	SQL	scripts	in	your	PDF	(for	repeating	SQL	queries	such	as	insert,	only	one	copy	
is	sufficient for	unique	inserts).
d. Export	your	database	(including	tables,	structures	and	data).	I	will	import	this	database	for	
review.
e. To	complete	this	section,	use	any	AI	tool	that	you	wish.	Write	up	max	500	words	in	your	AI	
Journal	on	how	you	leveraged	an	AI	tool	to	develop	the	MySQL	database.	Provide	your	top

代做程序编程语言es		responses	and	attach	at	the	end	of	this	DBMS.	Use	some	of	your	500	words	
in	your	AI	Journal	to	comment	on	these	AI	queries.
f. Max	10-minute	video	(screen	capture	recording)	of	you	describing	your	database,	the	logic	
behind	your	SQL	queries	and	how	you	 found	AI	useful/or	not	in	helping	you	to	develop	
your	database. The	more	knowledge	and	understanding	you	can	convey	of	your	database	
the	higher	the	marks.
5) Organisational	reports	to	support	decision	making

Databases for Management 
Information Systems
Assignment 1
Guide Description
Fail Very	poor,	clearly	inadequate	coverage	of	material,	badly	prepared,	poor	quality	and	
confusing.	Lack	of	understanding	as to	how	organisations	function	and	the	need	for	
databases.	AI	was	not	used	effectively.	Very	limited	supporting	logic or	references.
Pass	 A	clear	target	organisation	was	provided and a	rational	for	databases	was	given.
However,	no	critical	analysis	of how	decision	making	may	be	enhanced	was	provided.	A
basic	coverage	of	the	subject	area,	very	basic	MySQL	database with	a	limited	set	of	
supporting	references and	videos.
3H	 A	clear	target	organisation	was	provided and a	rational	for	databases	was	given with	
supporting	decision	making	rational. AI	was	used	but	at	a	basic	level,	limited	critical	
thinking	and	supporting	references,	the	videos	did	not	convey	a	very	high	level	of	
understanding. Very	basic	MySQL	solution	provided	with	limited	value	reports.
2H2	 A	clear	setting with	functional	requirements	and	decision	making	have	been clearly	
explained.	Reasonable	analysis	in	the	usage	of	AI.	The	MySQL	database	is	developed	to	a	
good	standard	but	limited	usage	of	SQL	key	functions.	AI	was	used	also	at	a	good	level	
but	did	not	critically	assess	their	usage	of	AI	in	the	AI	journal.
2H1 Clear	exposition	of	domain	and	a	good	selection	of	references.	The	AI	Journal	is	logically	
constructed	and	demonstrates	an	excellent	usage	of	the	AI	tool.	The	MySQL	database	is	
excellent	but	lacking	the	higher	features of	SQL	functions.	The	3	final	reports	cover	a	
good	spectrum	of	topics	but	lack	the	content	which	would	be	of	real	benefit	to	their	
target	organisation.
1H	 Outstanding.	Thorough	coverage	of	the	subject matter	i.e.	ERD,	MySQL,	AI	Journal	and	
supporting	videos	are	all	logically	constructed.	The	3	final	reports	clearly add	real	value	
to	the	target	organisation.	Perceptive	analysis	and	assessment	accompanied	by	
interesting/original	ideas	or	new	perspectives.	Excellent	report.
